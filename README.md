# US-Visa-Approval-Prediction
US Visa Approval Prediction is a machine learning–based project that predicts whether a US visa application will be approved or denied. It analyzes historical visa data using applicant, job, wage, and employer features to identify approval patterns and support data-driven decision making.

## 📌 Project Overview

Visa approval decisions depend on multiple factors such as job role, prevailing wage, employer details, and work location. This project builds a supervised learning model that learns from historical visa data and predicts the approval outcome for new applications. The application demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project, from data preprocessing to deployment.
